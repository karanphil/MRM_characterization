# MRM_characterization

This repository contains all the code and scripts used to produce results and
figures for "Crossing-fiber robust characterization of the orientation dependence
of magnetization transfer measures", submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

The main script used to characterize the orientation dependence of any measure is
scripts/scil_characterize_orientation_dependence.py. This will save ...

The bash scripts give examples of how to characterize multiple subjects or bundles
with one script. However, all the paths are hardcoded and will not apply directly
to another setup/data.
